## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.0 or later
- Git
- Make (for build automation)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intent-cli.git
   cd intent-cli
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/intentregistry/intent-cli.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Build the Project

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Build and package for macOS ARM64
make pack-darwin-arm64

# Generate checksums
make checksum
```

### Run Locally

```bash
# Run the CLI directly
go run ./cmd/intent --help

# Test specific commands
go run ./cmd/intent login
go run ./cmd/intent whoami
```

## Project Structure

### Key Components

- **`cmd/intent/main.go`**: Application entrypoint that registers all subcommands
- **`internal/cmd/`**: Contains all CLI subcommands using Cobra framework
- **`internal/config/`**: Handles configuration file and environment variable management
- **`internal/httpclient/`**: HTTP client wrapper for API interactions
- **`internal/pack/`**: Utilities for creating tar.gz packages

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the [Code Style Guidelines](#code-style-guidelines)

3. Test your changes thoroughly

4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages

### Adding New Commands

To add a new CLI command:

1. Create a new file in `internal/cmd/` (e.g., `newcommand.go`)
2. Implement the command using the Cobra framework
3. Register the command in `cmd/intent/main.go`
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Update documentation

Example command structure:
```go
package cmd

import (
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func NewCommandCmd() *cobra.Command {
    return &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "newcommand",
        Short: "Brief description",
        Long:  "Detailed description",
        RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
            // Command implementation
            return nil
        },
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./internal/cmd/
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP clients, file system, etc.)

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use clear, descriptive titles
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed

### Review Process

- All PRs require review from maintainers
- Address feedback promptly
- Keep discussions constructive and focused
- Be patient - maintainers are volunteers

## Release Process

Releases are automated and managed by maintainers. The process includes:

1. Version bumping
2. Building binaries for multiple platforms
3. Creating GitHub releases
4. Publishing to package managers

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use `golint` and `go vet` for code quality
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
